# Symbulation -- Agent based modeling of symbiont ecology and evolution
% MyST does not yet have support for field lists, so we need to use rST here

This is a software model of symbiosis which allows for evolution of
parasitism and mutualism.

Click [here](https://anyaevostinar.github.io/SymbulationEmp/web/symbulation.html) to
try it out in your web browser!

To build, you must first download Empirical
([https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical](https://github.com/devosoft/Empirical)) and place the two repositories
on the same level. Then within SymbulationEmp run
```
  make
  ./symbulation
```

The script 'stats\_scripts/simple\_repeat.py' can be
used to run many replicates and treatments.

The current settings can be configured in SymSettings.cfg.

To run end-to-end tests run 'make test'. This will overwrite the default
SymSettings.cfg!
